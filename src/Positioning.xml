<para>
Many visual components in Multigraph are positioned relative to something
else in the graph.  For example, a graph title or legend is typically
positioned (centered, left justified, right justified, etc) relative
to the entire graph window.  A title for an axis is usually positioned
relative to the axis, and labels along the axis are positioned
relative to the tic marks on the axis.  The axes themselves are positioned
relative to the plot area.
Multigraph uses a common
collection of attributes and conventions for relative positioning of
various components; this section describes these conventions and
attributes.
</para>

<para>
In the most general case, relative positioning can be thought of as the task of
placing a small rectangle, called the "placed rectangle", relative to a large rectangle,
called the "base rectangle".  (It may help
to think in terms of placing the placed rectangle "inside" the base
one, but in some cases the placed rectangle will be positioned so that
it extends beyond the edges of the base one, or lies outside it
completely.)  The placed rectangle might represent a legend or a text
string, for example, and the base rectangle represents some
rectangular region of the graph window --- for example, the plot area
where the data is plotted (see <xref linkend="BordersMarginsPlotArea"/>).
Each of these rectangles has a width and height in pixels, and
locations in the rectangle can be specified by giving pixel
coordinates.  Since it is sometimes awkward to specify locations in
pixels, though, Multigraph also makes use of a "relative" coordinate
system for each rectangle, in which the lower left corner has the
coordinates (-1,-1), and the upper right corner has coordinates (1,1).
The center of the rectangle has coordinate (0,0).

<para>
The top part of <xref linkend="figPositioning"/> shows an example in which the base
rectangle is blue and the placed rectangle is green, and
the "relative" coordinates of several key points in each rectangle
are marked.
We want to specify a location of the green rectangle relative to the
blue one.  We do so by choosing a "base" point in the blue rectangle,
and an "anchor" point in the green rectangle.  We then position the
green rectangle in the blue one so that its anchor point lines up with
the base point in the blue rectangle, but possibly offset by a
vector which is called the "position", and possibly at a given
"angle" to the horizontal.  The bottom part of
<xref linkend="figPositioning"/> shows the result.
</para>

<para>
In <xref linkend="figPositioning"/>, the base point is (1,0) and the anchor
point is (1,-1).  The base point is specified in the relative coordinates
of the base rectangle, and the anchor point is in the relative coordinates
of the placed rectangle.  The "position" is a vector that indicates an offset
of the anchor point away from the base point in the final positioning; it is specified
in pixels rather than relative coordinates.  In the figure, the position vector
looks like it might be something like (-30,-20).  The "angle" is specified in
degrees, with positive angles pointing counterclockwise, so in the figure the
angle appears to be roughly -45.
</para>

<para>
These four quantities, the base, anchor, position, and angle, 
are available for several tags in &mugl; files using the
<sgmltag>base</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>position</sgmltag>,
and
<sgmltag>angle</sgmltag>
attributes.
Values for the
<sgmltag>base</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag>,
and
<sgmltag>position</sgmltag>
attributes are specified as a pair of numbers separated by a space,
without parentheses.  These attributes allow for any arbitrary
positioning of the placed rectangle relative to the base rectangle in a way
that makes many common alignment possibilities easy to specify.  For
example, to center a text string (think of the green rectangle as
representing a text string) just under the top edge of the blue rectangle,
use
base="0 1",
anchor="0 1",
position="0 0",
angle="0".
If you want to add a few pixels of vertical space between the top
of the text and the top edge of the blue rectangle, use something
like
position="0 -5",
which shifts the text down by 5 pixels.
To center
a text string just ABOVE the top edge of the blue rectangle, use
base="0 1",
anchor="0 -1",
position="0 0",
angle="0".
To right justify a legend
(now think of the green rectangle as a legend) along the middle of the
right edge of the blue rectangle, use 
base="1 0",
anchor="1 0",
position="0 0",
angle="0".
</para>

<para>
Having the base and anchor points specified in relative coordinates
but the position vector in pixels might seem odd at first, but this 
turns out to be a powerful combintation that allows you to specify locations that do not
depend on the exact pixel size of the graph, and that continue to work
correctly if and when the size of the graph is changed.  Think of
<sgmltag>base</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>and</sgmltag> angle as the main way that an object is
positioned, and <sgmltag>position</sgmltag> as an offset to allow for
a small amount of padding.  Often the amount of padding that looks best
depends on the font size being used, or on the pixel size of an object,
so <sgmltag>position</sgmltag> is given in pixels.  The
<sgmltag>base</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag> points, though,
specify relative location and alignment and do not depend on specific pixel
measurements.
</para>

<para>
Some &mugl; tags that use these attributes do not allow all of them; for example, the
<sgmltag>legend</sgmltag> tag does now allow the
<sgmltag>angle</sgmltag> attribute, because legends cannot be rotated (legends are always
displayed with an angle of 0).  Most 
&mugl; tags that use these attributes have default values for them, so that you only
need to specify attributes that differ from the defaults.  The default values vary depending
on the tag; see the documentation for each tag to find out what its default attribute values are.
</para>

<para>
In some situations the base point is determined by context and there
is no need (or it doesn't make sense) to think in terms of a base
rectangle.  For example, when positioning an axis title, the base
point is the center point of the axis, so the <sgmltag>title</sgmltag>
subelement of the axis elements takes <sgmltag>position</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag>, and <sgmltag>angle</sgmltag> attributes
that position the title relative to the axis center point, and the
<sgmltag>base</sgmltag> attributes is not needed (or allowed).
</para>

<para>
There is one more attribute that is sometimes used in connection with positioning.
Some &mugl; tags accept the <sgmltag>frame</sgmltag> attribute as a way of identifying
the base rectangle.  It typically takes values like "plot" or "padding", to
indicate that the base rectangle is the plot box or the padding box, respectively; see
<xref linkend="BordersMarginsPlotArea"/> for a description of these boxes.  In
most cases, though, the base rectangle is determined by the context and there
is no need (or allowance) for a <sgmltag>frame</sgmltag> attribute.
</para>

<para>
In some cases either the base rectangle or the placed rectangle may 
actually not be a rectangle, but rather just a line segment.
For example, when specifying the location of an axis relative to
the plot area, the "placed rectangle" is the axis.  In cases
such as this, where the placed rectangle is a line (segment), the 
<sgmltag>anchor</sgmltag> attribute can take a value that is a
single number ranging from -1 to 1 that represents a location along the line segment,
rather than a pair of numbers.  Similarly, in cases where the "base
rectangle" is a line segment, such as when positioning an axis
title relative to the axis, the <sgmltag>base</sgmltag> attribute
can be a single number between -1 and 1.
